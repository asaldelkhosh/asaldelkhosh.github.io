## Educations

I ranked within the top 5% in the __Iran's national university entrance__ exam and secured admission to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department at __Amirkabir University of Technology__, one of Iran's top three universities. I chose Mathematics as my major, but as I delved deeper into the subject, I uncovered its strong ties to Computer Science. Recognizing how my mathematical understanding could enrich my grasp of CS, I opted for a minor in Computer Science.
