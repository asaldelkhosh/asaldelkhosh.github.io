<!--more-->

One of the problems in every transportation system like airplane companies, social bus services, or cab applications is to add new routes in their system which will be used by their clients and brings income to their business. But how can they decide about which route is the best for them to add it in their system? Since techniques like trial-and-error method can cost huge amount of money and resource for companies, they cannot Kind these routes by experimenting or using random methods. In this paper we are representing a solution in order to Kind these routes. By implementing a recommendation system, we take the routes data and users search results, then we return a list of most wanted routes by users with a value for each suggestion in order to compare them.
